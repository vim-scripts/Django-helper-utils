#note. This is only tested on linux with python support. in my ~/.bashrc I have the following line which allows django modules to be imported 

export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=settings

Resolve a url to a tag 

Usage

for a given django url path

urlpatterns(
 '/some/url/path', 'some.django.view.function_name'
)

:DUrlTag /some/relative/path/

will resolve the path to the function and then call
:tag function_name

You need to have an up to date tags file and the command might choke on
complicated views with lots of decorators etc.


:DClient /some/relative/path/

will dump the html in a scratch window split

if settings.py is in the root  of the path this script will :set path+= all template directories including INSTALLED_APPS, 

so you can 'gf' to template files
